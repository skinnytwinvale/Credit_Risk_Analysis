# Credit Risk Analysis

## Overview of Project
Jill commends you for all your hard work. Piece by piece, you’ve been building up your skills in data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning. You are now ready to apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk.

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, you’ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, you’ll oversample the data using the `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms, and undersample the data using the `ClusterCentroids` algorithm. Then, you’ll use a combinatorial approach of over and undersampling using the `SMOTEENN` algorithm. Next, you’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, `BalancedRandomForestClassifier` and `EasyEnsembleClassifier`, to predict credit risk. Once you’re done, you’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

### Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk
#### Predicting Credit Risk

##### Create a Machine Learning Environment

Your new virtual environment will use Python 3.7 and accompanying Anaconda packages. After creating the new virtual environment, you'll install the imbalanced-learn library in that environment.

**NOTE**
Consult the [imbalanced-learn documentation](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for additional information about the imbalanced-learn library.

Check out the macOS instructions below, or go down to the Windows instructions.

**macOS Setup**
Before we create a new environment in macOS, we'll need to update the global conda environment:

1. If your PythonData environment is activated when you launch the command line, deactivate the environment.

2. Update the global conda environment by typing conda update conda and press Enter.

3. After all the packages are collected, you'll see the prompt Proceed ([y]/n)?. Press the "Y" key (for "yes") and press Enter.

4. In the command line, type conda create -n mlenv python=3.7 anaconda. The name of your new environment is mlenv.

5. After all the packages are collected, you'll see the prompt Proceed ([y]/n)?. Press the "Y" key (for "yes") and press Enter.

6. Activate your mlenv environment by typing conda activate mlenv and press Enter.

##### Check Dependencies for the imbalanced-learn Package
Before we install the imbalanced-learn package, we need to confirm that all of the package dependencies are satisfied in our mlenv environment:

* NumPy, version 1.11 or later
* SciPy, version 0.17 or later
* Scikit-learn, version 0.21 or later


On the command line, you can check all packages that begin with numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn when you type conda list | grep and press Enter. The grep command will search for patterns of the text numpy in our conda list. For example, when we type conda list | grep numpy and press Enter, the output should be as follows:

![d1](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/s1.png)

As you can see, our numpy dependency meets the installation requirements for the imbalanced-learn package.

Additionally, you can type python followed by the command argument -c, and then "import `package_name`;print(`package_name`.__version__)" to verify which version of a package is installed in an environment, where `package_name` is the name of the package you want to verify.

Type python -c "import numpy ;print(numpy.__version__)" and then press Enter to see the version of numpy in your mlenv environment.

##### Windows Setup
Before we create a new environment in Windows, we'll need to update the global conda environment:

1. Launch the Anaconda Prompt, or open your PythonData Anaconda Prompt and deactivate this environment.

2. Update the global conda environment by typing conda update conda and press Enter

3. After all the packages are collected, you'll see the prompt Proceed ([y]/n)?. Press the "Y" key (for "yes") and press Enter.

4. In the command line, type conda create -n mlenv python=3.7 anaconda.

5. After all the packages are collected, you'll see the prompt Proceed ([y]/n)?. Press the "Y" key (for "yes") and press Enter.

6. Activate your mlenv environment by typing conda activate mlenv and press Enter, or open your Anaconda Prompt (mlenv).

##### Check Dependencies for the imbalanced-learn Package
Before we install the imbalanced-learn package, we need to confirm that all of the package dependencies are satisfied in our mlenv environment:

* NumPy, version 1.11 or later
* SciPy, version 0.17 or later
* Scikit-learn, version 0.21 or later


In the Anaconda Prompt, you can check all packages that begin with numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn when you type conda list | findstr and press Enter. The findstr command will search for patterns of the text in our conda list. For example, when we type conda list | findstr numpy and press Enter, the output should be as follows:

![d1](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/s2.png)

From the output, we can see that our numpy dependency meets the installation requirements for the imbalanced-learn package.

Additionally, you can type python followed by the command argument -c, and then "import `package_name`;print(`package_name`.__version__)" to verify which version of a package is installed in an environment, where `package_name` is the name of the package you want to verify:

Type python -c "import numpy;print(numpy.__version__)" and press Enter to see the version of numpy in your mlenv environment.


##### Install the imbalanced-learn Package
Now that our dependencies have been met, we can install the imbalanced-learn package in our mlenv environment.

With the mlenv environment activated, either in the Terminal in macOS or in the Anaconda Prompt (mlenv) in Windows, type the following:

`conda install -c conda-forge imbalanced-learn`

Then press Enter.

After all the packages are collected, you'll see the prompt `Proceed` `([y]/n)?`. Press the "Y" key (for "yes") and press Enter.


##### Add the Machine Learning Environment to Jupyter Notebook
To use the mlenv environment we just created in the Jupyter Notebook, we need to add it to the kernels. In the command line, type `python -m ipykernel install --user --name mlenv` and press Enter.

To check if the mlenv is installed, launch the Jupyter Notebook and click the "New" dropdown menu:

![d1](https://github.com/emmanuelmartinezs/Credit_Risk_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Images/s3.png)

Now we can begin our machine learning journey.

# Deliverable 1:  
## Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk 
### Deliverable Requirements:

Using your knowledge of the `imbalanced-learn` and `scikit-learn` libraries, you’ll evaluate three machine learning models by using resampling to determine which is better at predicting credit risk. First, you’ll use the oversampling `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms, and then you’ll use the undersampling `ClusterCentroids` algorithm. Using these algorithms, you’ll resample the dataset, view the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.

> To Deliver. 

**Follow the instructions below:**

Follow the instructions below and use the `credit_risk_resampling_starter_code.ipynb` file to complete Deliverable 1.

Open the `credit_risk_resampling_starter_code.ipynb` file, rename it `credit_risk_resampling.ipynb`, and save it to your **Credit_Risk_Analysis** folder.

Using the information we’ve provided in the starter code, create your training and target variables by completing the following steps:

* Create the training variables by converting the string values into numerical ones using the `get_dummies()` method.
* Create the target variables.
* Check the balance of the target variables.

Next, begin resampling the training data. First, use the oversampling `RandomOverSampler` and `SMOTE` algorithms to resample the data, then use the undersampling `ClusterCentroids` algorithm to resample the data. For each resampling algorithm, do the following:

* Use the `LogisticRegression` classifier to make predictions and evaluate the model’s performance.
* Calculate the accuracy score of the model.
* Generate a confusion matrix.
* Print out the imbalanced classification report.
